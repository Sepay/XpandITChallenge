# XpandIT Scala Spark2 Challenge


This is my answer to a big data challenger. This was my first time working with scala and spark. I've some experience with pyspark which is basically the same so I just had to transform the python knowledge in scala knowledge.

Before anything I want to say 2 things that I could not do about this challenge.

### Scala, Spark and Maven Setup

The first thing is, as the challenge says, the dependencies should be in maven. I already worked with maven but for some reason that I'm still trying to understand, I couldn't this time, so as a solution I used the sbt file for dependencies.

The second thing is for part 2,4,5 of the challenge where we needed to write the final dataframe to a csv file, and again I could not do it, this time I really think it is because of versions. I think my code is right and in normal circunstances it would work. This code is written as commentary so that the program could run.
In the end my dataframes were correct and I proved it in the code.

### About the Challenge

This challenge is to handle data from 2 csv files with multiple tasks to be done.
